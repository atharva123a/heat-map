            Scrollytelling with scrollama.js and d3.js (demo)
        </h1>
        <p>
            This is a scrollytelling demo. 
            It was created using scrollama.js and d3.js. 
            It assumes your screen is at least 1100 pixels wide
            and it has only been tested on a modern Firefox browser.
            Technical notes are down below.
        </p>
        <p>
            Have fun.

                <h2>Parallel Set Plot</h2>
                <p>
                Parallel plot or parallel coordinates plot allows to 
                compare the feature of several individual observations 
                (series) on a set of numeric variables. Each vertical 
                bar represents a variable and often has its own scale. 
                (The units can even be different). Values are then 
                plotted as series of lines connected across each axis.

                <h2>Example</h2>
                <p>
                    The Ã¬ris dataset provides four features (each represented 
                    with a vertical line) for 8 flower samples (each 
                    represented with a color line). Samples are grouped in 
                    Two species. The chart beside highlights efficiently.
                    Here the Blue color represent the species "<span class="label red"> Setosa </span>"
                    and the orangish  <span class="label green">versicolor</span>.    
                </p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="step" data-step="2">
                <h2></h2>
                <p>
                Let's consider two features: Sepal Length and Sepal Width. We observe that the Sepal Length of the Versicolor species is longer than that of Setosa.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="step" data-step="3">
                <h2></h2>
                <p>
                    In the case of the first three features, Sepal Length, Sepal Width, and Petal Length, we can make the following observations:

                    For the Setosa species, as the Sepal Width increases, the Petal Length tends to decrease. In other words, Setosa flowers with wider sepals tend to have shorter petals.
                    Conversely, for the Versicolor species, when the Sepal Width is shorter, the Petal Length tends to be longer. This means that Versicolor flowers with narrower sepals tend to have longer petals.
                   
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="step" data-step="4">
                <h2></h2>
                <p>
                    Let's consider the other two features: Petal Length and Petal Width. We observe that in the case of the Versicolor species, both Petal Length and Petal Width are longer and wider compared to Setosa
                   
                </p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="step" data-step="5">
                <h2>What for</h2>
                <p>
                    A parallel plot allows to study the features of samples for several quantitative variables. Its strength is that the variables can even be completely different: different ranges and even different units.

                    In the graphic above flower features were grouped in species, and all variables were normalized and sharing the same unit (cm). 
                </p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="step" data-step="6">
                <h2> Common Mistake</h2>
                <p>
                Like for line plot, displaying too many samples result in a cluttered and unreadable spaghetti chart.
                Sort the variables on the X axis, it makes sense to avoid crosses in sample lines.
                Try different scalings to find the one fitting your data best.
                    
                </p>

                <h2>The result</h2>
                <p>
                    When I clean up the final visualisation, I get a nice view of the generated shape.
                    Keep in mind that this is all generated using code.
                    But it doesn't look like that.
                    It looks like it's a hand-drawn signature. 
                    Pretty cool right?

            That's a wrap.
